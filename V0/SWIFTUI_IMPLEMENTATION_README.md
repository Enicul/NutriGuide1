## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation
1. Copy any individual file(s) to your Xcode project
2. Each file is self-contained and will compile independently
3. Use the mock ViewModels for demonstration, replace with real implementations

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Home View
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NutriHomeView(viewModel: MockHomeViewModel())
    }
}
```

#### Complete App with Tab Navigation
```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyNutriApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            NutriRootView(viewModel: MockRootViewModel())
        }
    }
}
```

## üéØ Mock Data

Each view includes comprehensive mock data for demonstration:

- **Health States**: Calm, Stressed, Low Energy, Post-Workout, Sleep Prep, Focus Needed
- **Food Items**: Detailed nutrition information, preparation time, difficulty
- **Health Metrics**: Heart rate, steps, sleep, stress, calories, oxygen levels
- **User Preferences**: Dietary restrictions, allergies, goals
- **Location Data**: Nearby restaurants, markets, healthy options

## üì± Previews

Each file includes `PreviewProvider` with:
- **iPhone 15 Pro** preview device
- **DevicePreview** wrapper for realistic device appearance
- **Rounded corners** simulation
- **Multiple preview scenarios** where applicable

## üîß Customization

### Colors and Themes
All colors are defined in the design system using semantic tokens:
```swift
// Background colors
.backgroundPrimary
.backgroundSecondary
.backgroundCard

// Text colors
.textPrimary
.textSecondary
.textTertiary

// Accent colors
.accentPrimary
.accentSecondary
```

### Typography
Typography system with Dynamic Type support:
```swift
Text("Hello").largeTitle()
Text("World").title()
Text("Content").body()
```

### Components
Reusable components ready for customization:
- `NutriCard` - Primary container component
- `HealthStateTag` - Status indicators
- `NutritionBadge` - Nutritional information
- Button styles - Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

## üîí Privacy & Security
